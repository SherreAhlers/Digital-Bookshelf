# Digital-Bookshelf 

This app allows the user to store a collection of books and comments. The user will have the ability to add, edit or delete the comments they post.

## Technologies Used
For this app I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery, and CRUD.


## Digital-Bookshelf Wireframe
1. Begin by implementing the Oauth, so the app requires a logged in user to add to and edit the app.
2. Next, create book model. Inside the book model are details about the book, such as the title, author, year pubilshed, a book category, and a checkbox for if the book is also a movie.
3. The book model needs a set of routes for the http requests to follow, beginning with a route to the index page (the all books page).
4. Then I will need a controller for my books to perform the callback functions for the http requests.
5. I will need functions for diplaying the index page (all books page), for displaying the show page (details page), for creating a new book (new page) and rendering it on the index page (all books page)
6. I will need to create a views section to render the html that will display the pages.
7. Then I will follow the same steps to implement my comments model, routes, and controllers.
